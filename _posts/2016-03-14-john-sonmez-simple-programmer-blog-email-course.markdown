The first is to write up a post on your blog about this email course.

Make sure within the post you link to http://simpleprogrammer.com (so, I see the pingback that lets me know you wrote the post) and for the email course sign-up, you can link to: http://devcareerboost.com/blog-course/

1. I am going to be putting a list together of all the blog posts talking about this email course and I'll be linking to them. That means--as long as you write a quality post about this email course--I will link to you from SimpleProgrammer.com. This will help you get some traffic, (remember how important backlinks are.) Just make sure you write a quality post--that's all I ask.
