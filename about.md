Hi.  My name is Kris Krause.  I write software.  Language and platform?  Depends on the problem.

First computer programmed?  The [TRS-80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80).  I remember hanging out at the local Radio Shack entering silly programs outputting childish phrases on the TV screen in an infinite loop.  Most of the salesmen kept an eye on me whenever entering the store.  Fortunately, my middle school purchased a computer and I learned [Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_%28programming_language%29) to instruct a turtle to draw lines and circles on the screen.

First decent program written?  In middle school I disliked studying for a history tests.  So I developed (in BASIC) a multiple choice quiz that randomly selected questions and randomized answer choices.  At the end, it summed up your score and told the user (which was just me) which ones I got wrong.  I regret losing the 5.25 inch floppy and not entering my program in the school science fair.

First computer owned?  The [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64) with the floppy and tape drives.  I copied games like crazy (both sides of the floppy) as well as learning BASIC.

First professional job?  [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) and [VB3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic) in 1996 for a pharmaceutical sofware company that used the [waterfall model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) (we were regulated my the Food and Drug Administration).
