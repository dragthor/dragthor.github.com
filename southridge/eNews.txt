Hello eNewsers,

Memorial Day is behind us and it feels like summer! This is the kind of weather that makes the corn sprout, the strawberries ready to pick, and the hay ready to cut. That’s the farmer blood in me.

This Sunday I will be tackling Mark 6:14-29. In contrast to what we have seen in Mark so far where Jesus has been traveling, performing miracles, and teaching this passage is a parenthesis that tells us about the sordid life of Herod and how that led to the ultimate execution of John. It’s a disturbing account that leads to a shocking outcome.

In many ways this ancient story is not so distant. It surfaces many of the same questions our modern day culture grapples with. What is right? What is wrong? Is there such a thing as right and wrong? Does it really make any difference? We’ll be swimming in the deep end of the pool on Sunday so come ready to wrestle hard and engage deeply. Communion will be a fitting conclusion to the service.

Thank you for your continued financial generosity to South Ridge. I’ll take a minute or so this Sunday to provide a short update about where South Ridge presently stands. We have much to be thankful for. God’s kingdom is moving forward and His grace is penetrating darkness. We get to be part of it. Thank you for being part of it.

Together for Him,

Nathan
