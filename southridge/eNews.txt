Hello eNews Friends,

A midweek email about a few things:

1. If you haven’t taken on the “Gospel Reading Schedule,” now would be a great time to start! We just completed Matthew and today we are at Mark 2. Access the Gospel Reading schedule online.

2. This Thursday, May, 2nd, is the National Day of Prayer. I particularly focus on global needs on this date and there are two that I would encourage you to pray for.

- SRCC’s African Ministry Partners in Zimbabwe: Elections in Zimbabwe are scheduled to be held in June and this, as anticipated, has brought an upsurge in tension, disruption of people’s lives, and political violence. Nyasha Manyau’s (who visited SRCC in February) home and office have been raided and one of her partners has been kidnapped. The whereabouts of this partner is still unknown after several days. Also, Pastor Henry’s (whose church operates the children’s home SRCC has partnered in purchasing) community is being impacted as well in dealing with increased challenges and needs. Please pray diligently for the whole country of Zimbabwe and especially SRCC’s African ministry partners.

- Please pray for Saeed Abedinie. Saeed is a prisoner in Iran and his story has gotten national and even global attention. There are multiple news outlets for his story. You can click here to be linked to one report.

Don’t wait until Thursday! Take some time during the next 3-4 days and intentionally direct your thoughts in prayer to God. Pray that evil in our world would be thwarted; pray for courage and boldness for those who are followers of Jesus; pray that light would pierce darkness; pray that God’s will would be done on earth as it is in heaven.

Praying Together,

Nathan
