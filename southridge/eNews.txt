Hello eNews Friends,

This Sunday South Ridge begins the message series called Footsteps taken from Mark’s gospel. Although we will hardly get out of verse 1, the Scripture passage we will look at is Mark 1:1-5 with a message entitled “Who Is Jesus?”. I am excited about this journey of looking directly at Jesus that will take us all the way through until daylight starts getting shorter (OK . . . I shouldn’t have brought that up!). It goes until the end of June.

Jesus is 100% central to the Christian faith. In fact, we might as well say that Jesus IS the Christian faith. Throughout this series, I would challenge you to wrestle deeply with who Jesus is, what Jesus did, and the words Jesus said. Don’t take what you know for granted; don’t allow Jesus to be familiar. Pray that God’s Spirit would make the truth of Jesus freshly alive in your soul, and that you would be reawakened to the fact that EVERYTHING is about Jesus.

This Sunday South Ridge will also be launching Feed the Need 2013. Get ready!

Enjoy this beautiful sunshine! I’m so thankful for the cold beautiful weather after a string of some soupy and swampy days.

Together For Him,

Nathan
