Hello eNews Friends,

Today is March 29th, the day designated as “Good Friday.” Luke tells us that from 12 noon until 3:00 in the afternoon when Jesus died it became dark. Saturday was a blank, silent, and seemingly forgotten day. On Easter Sunday Jesus rose from the dead.

If you haven’t done any of the gospel reading schedule up to this point, I encourage you to finish off the last three days of March by reading the final four chapters of John’s gospel. Read John 18 & 19 today; read John 20 on Saturday; finish with John 21 on Sunday. Read it thoughtfully and meditatively. I’m sure God’s Spirit will speak to you.

This evening SRCC will have its Good Friday service at 7:00 pm. We will also be having communion. It will be a powerful evening as we reflect on Jesus death on our behalf.

By now you are probably aware of the times of SRCC’s Easter services - 4:00 & 6:00 on Saturday and the regular times of 9:00 & 10:45 on Easter Sunday. Thank you to the many of you planning to attend on Saturday! Pray hard, invite others, and come prepared to celebrate Jesus’ resurrection. It will be a powerful service.

Lastly, toward the end of this week my dad has not been doing well. He has been in a nursing home for several weeks. Nobody’s quite certain how long he will be alert and responsive so I will be visiting him this afternoon and tomorrow morning in Pennsylvania. I will really miss being here for SRCC’s Good Friday service, but I will be back for Easter services Saturday and Sunday.

Together Because of Him,

Nathan
