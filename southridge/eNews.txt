Hello eNews Friends,

Take heart . . . mid fifties and sunny tomorrow!

And don’t forget to turn the clocks ahead on Saturday! Plan your Saturday taking into account the lost hour. Don’t wait until late Saturday evening, lose an hour of sleep, and then be tired and unengaged Sunday morning. Give God the most wide-awake moments that you can possibly give him this Sunday. And don’t stop there. Give yourself margin so that you are on time, clear-minded, and ready to engage with God each Sunday leading up to Easter.

Speaking of Sundays, I am jumping ahead in our Mark message series. Beginning this Sunday through Easter, we will look at passages in Mark 14-16 with a series entitled Path to the Cross. I sense God will do great things in our lives and in South Ridge as a whole during these weeks. We will take an undiluted look at Jesus defining work - His crucifixion and resurrection. 

This Sunday, I will focus on Mark 14:12-16 with a message entitled "Meal to Remember"; we will also have communion. I believe this will be a powerful time and that God’s Spirit will give us a fresh perspective of Jesus' death on the cross. Come with your heart wide open; I’m confident it will be filled.

Please also pray for Feed the Need. This is a major event in so many ways. Pray for the working of God’s Spirit in it and through it.

Together For Him,

Nathan
