Hello eNews Friends,

Thank you all once again for the amazing fifteen year celebration last Sunday. I am so blessed to be part of South Ridge and to have all of you as family. South Ridge has enriched my life beyond measure, and it is impossible for me to express the level to which God has used all of you to build into my life! THANK YOU so much.

Nyasha Manyau who will be sharing her story with us on Sunday arrived this past Wednesday. Several of us have already had the opportunity and privilege to spend some time with her. Nyasha’s life is an exceptional story of grace, forgiveness and transformation. There is no sense in which that path has been easy. It has been filled with pain and challenges, but as Nyasha has chosen to lose her life for the sake of Christ, she has found it in amazing ways. She is a woman of humility, grace, boldness and enormous strength. I can’t wait for her to share her story and for all of you to hear it. It will be a high-impact day.

From what I understand the ladies dessert night in nearly full, and I know quite a number of people have already registered for the Leaders’ Gathering. More information and registration for each of these events can be found on South Ridge’s home page.

Together For Him,

Nathan
