Hello eNews Friends,

I hope you are all enjoying this beautiful day!

This Sunday we will be looking at Mark 2:23-3:6. What jumps out at me in looking at these verses is how quickly we human beings distort God’s love – our natural tendency is to take God’s good gifts and somehow twist them from what He originally intended.

SRCC Ministry Partners Bud & Mandy Jackson are back from Zimbabwe and will also be saying “hello” and giving an update. Bud & Mandy have provided SRCC with some rich ministry opportunities in Zimbabwe; we are truly thankful for the doors that have been opened to us through them. It was through Bud & Mandy that we were introduced to Nyasha Manyau who will be sharing here at SRCC on the following Sunday, February 24th.

On Sunday afternoons February 24th & March 3rd will be Discovering South Ridge (DSR). Whether you are new to SRCC or you would like to consider membership, SRCC is a great next step. You will meet some other people, have time to interact with SRCC ministry staff, and learn much about SRCC’s history, ministries, and beliefs. You can register on the South Ridge home page.

Lastly, if you lost track, our gospel reading schedule has us up to Luke 2. You can check out that schedule online as well.

Together For Him,

Nathan
