Hello eNewsers,

This coming weekend Church Street Drama presents the musical Acorn to Oaks once on Saturday at 1:15pm and twice on Sunday at the regular Sunday morning service times. Saturday’s program is always special with residents from the Hunterdon Developmental Center across the street coming to enjoy the presentation. I love it that SRCC’s children have such a blast presenting the program to these folks.

Also, you can still join the South Ridge schedule for reading through the gospels. If you got behind or feel guilty about procrastinating you can jump up, brush off the dust and get going. The schedule is available online, and as of today we are at Luke 3. It’s a great time to begin. If you are up to date – way to go!

This morning I was doing some catching up of my own and was reading Luke 1. Verse 37 of Luke 1 has been in my head all day. “For nothing is impossible with God.” Whatever else you have to think about today or during the weekend, take some time to meditate, focus, and let that sink deeply into your soul.

Together For Him,

Nathan
