Hello eNewsers,

With this weekend being Mothers’ Day we will spend some moments on Sunday honoring mothers, thanking God for them, and praying for God’s empowering Spirit in their lives. In a world where high-profile shakers and movers generally get the most media attention and accolades, we can forget that the role of the day-to-day mom is one of the most culture-shaping influences in the history of the world. It is because a mom’s role IS day-to-day that moms have such significant influence and literally shape our world.

On that note, I also got to thinking how much the enemy of our souls attacks the “mom” dynamic. Not far behind the “mom” reality come feelings of inadequacy, guilt, regret, longing, disappointment, fear, and a host of other similar things. Don’t ever let the Prince of Darkness sabotage the “mom reality” by dragging it into any of these pits. “Our God is greater.”

This Sunday I will be looking at Mark 6:1-6. It’s a short passage of Scripture, but has one shocking six word sentence. “And they took offense at Him.” That short sentence packs a load of meaning. We will explore that on Sunday.

One last update for Crossroads Christian Academy’s “Walk by Faith” fundraising event – the goal was to raise $35,000. To date, $36,000 has been raised, and the number is still climbing. The reward for the students' meeting the goal is they go bowling next Friday. My ears are still ringing from the response of the kids when it was announced via school-wide intercom that the goal had been met. It’s pretty cool.

Together for Him,

Nathan
