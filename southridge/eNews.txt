Hello eNews Friends,

I hear we are in for a BEAUTIFUL weekend! I hope all of you are looking forward to enjoying it as much as I am.

The latest news from Nyahsa is that her helper/partner has been found. She is traumatized from what she went through. Details are not clear, but please keep praying.

I am fired up about this Sunday! We are privileged to have a couple from Zimbabwe, Rob & Lisa Chifokoyo, with us; they will say a brief “hello.” Rob & Lisa are courageously leading the way with many young people in Zimbabwe, and God is using them in powerful ways. You will only get a glimpse on Sunday, but the glimpse will be stirring.

Also on Sunday, I will be looking at Mark 5:24-34. From this passage, God has placed some things on my own heart that have deeply stirred me when it comes to the implications of living out the gospel. We will walk on some “unsafe” territory, and I believe God’s Spirit will open our eyes to see some things from a fresh perspective.  We will conclude the service with communion.

If you’re in the car driving this afternoon, turn the radio off and allow your spirit to drink in the goodness of our great God. Then, come on Sunday with a heart wide open to serve and worship. Be on time!

Together For Him,

Nathan
