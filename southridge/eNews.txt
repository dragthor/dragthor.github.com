Hello eNews Friends,

A quick early-in-the-week eNews –

This past weekend’s Feed The Need event was truly a work of God. A total of 544,920 meals got packed by over 2,400 volunteers and $119,000 was given. Goals were broken in meals packed, volunteers serving, and donations received! I am truly reminded that “Our God is Greater,” and I am so thankful and grateful for the mighty work of God’s Spirit among us.

This is enough food for 1,491 children to have one meal a day for a year. And as you probably know, much of this food will be going to Zimbabwe and Swaziland, a region of the world where SRCC is already highly engaged.

Beyond the food, I can’t express how powerful it was to have people from all walks of life and from all backgrounds – both religious and nonreligious – participate in this event. The fruits to this will continue long after this weekend.

A quick reminder – this Wednesday evening (March 20th) at 6:30 pm I will be leading Understanding Baptism in the office area. If you have never been baptized as a follower of Christ, this would be the time to take the step. The sense of following after Christ through baptism is a powerful experience that I can’t imagine saying no to. Simply reply to this email and let Angela know that you would like to participate.

Spring arrives tomorrow! . . . although more snow/rain is forecasted for next Monday. What’s the deal with this?

Together For Him,

Nathan
