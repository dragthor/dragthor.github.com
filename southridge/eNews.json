[{"Date":"October 4th 2012","Author":"Nathan Tuckey","Message":"<p>Hello eNews Friends,</p><p>I think we are all looking forward to some forecasted sunny days ahead!</p><p>This coming Sunday I will continue our message series, Colors of the New Community, by looking at <a href='http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%208:1-9&version=NIV;NLT;MSG;NASB' target='_blank'>2 Corinthians 8:1-9</a>. As I hope to explain on Sunday, if we have truly embraced God's grace it should result in our lives being characterized by vivid and visible colors. While our relationship with God is "spiritual", it has enormous implications for how we make decisions in concrete and practical areas of life. In the passage for this Sunday, Paul talks about the color of generosity. I'm looking forward to it.</p><p>The reason this note is showing up Thursday rather than Friday is to highlight a note in last Sunday's Weekly. I commented on this second service but it slipped my mind first service. As the Weekly note stated, the SRCC Elders have formed a Review Team to review the ministry of Crossroads Christian Academy (CCA). This Review Team was catalyzed by decreasing enrollment in recent years and consequent financial challenges.</p><p>As a result, the Review Team has set up a series of meetings to communicate some information about CCA and solicit some input and ideas. If you have a child in Crossroads, this isn't new information; you received a letter over a week ago. If you don't have a child in CCA, but value Christian education and are interested in CCA you can read the attached letter that provides further details about the meetings. Anyone is welcome to participate.</p><p>For everyone, I encourage you to check out Crossroads newly created video on the upper left corner of SRCC's <a href='http://www.southridgecc.org/' target='_blank'>web site</a>.</p><p>btw - mouse update . . . two more :)  [you had to be there to get that]</p><p>Together For Him,</p><p>Nathan</p>"}]
