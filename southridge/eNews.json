[{"Date":"Friday, April 05, 2013","Author":"Nathan Tuckey","Passage":"Mark 3:20-30","Message":"<p>Hello eNews Friends,</p><p>I hope you are all enjoying the sunshine filled spring days. It's April and I'm ready for warmer temperatures!</p><p>I am so thankful for the movement of God's Spirit through the Good Friday and Easter services last weekend. We will be celebrating that this coming Sunday. Thank you to all of you who invited, prayed, adjusted the time of the service you attended, and came with hearts wide open to celebrate Christ's resurrection.</p><p>This Sunday I am greatly looking forward to sharing from Mark 3:20-30. It's not the most familiar Scripture or the easiest one for a message, but I feel strongly that God will use it. I'm very eager to dive into what I sense God has placed on my heart for this passage. I believe all of us will be deeply challenged.</p><p>Thank you so much for prayers for my dad and family. I've been able t o spend significant time this week with them. I am sitting by my dad's bed right now. It was thought he would pass momentarily yesterday. Some people say he's stubborn . . . but I know that doesn't run in any other family members . . . lol. I have been blessed with incredibly rich moments, sharing and much time. I plan on being with you all this Sunday. I feel like my \"tank\" is full with God's grace; I have been richly blessed with family time; and by Sunday I anticipate wanting to be with my South Ridge family.</p><p>Together for Him,</p><p>Nathan</p>"}]
