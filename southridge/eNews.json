[{"Date":"November 30th 2012","Author":"Nathan Tuckey","Message":"<p>Hello eNews Friends,</p><p>While it's a little bit raw out there now, I hear we are headed toward sixty degrees in the next several days. Maybe we are skipping winter . . . or maybe not. And, in just twenty-one days the amount of daylight will begin to increase!</p><p>This Sunday I will begin our new Christmas message series entitled Old Fashioned Christmas. While the birth of Christ is probably the best known \"story\" in the Bible, we understand the significance of Christmas only by looking at how it fits in the whole story of the Bible. Rather than being an encyclopedia of collected stories and moral guidelines, the Bible is a single story telling us the truth about where we came from, why we are here, and where we are headed. It is the true story in which we live.</p><p>On Sunday we are going to connect some verses from the earliest chapters of Genesis to some comments by Paul in Romans. Those books in the Bible span across thousands of years in human history, but the dots connect and the reality of Jesus birth fits right into the heart of it all. You may want to check out <a target='_blank' href='http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%205:12-19&version=NIV;NLT;MSG'>Romans 5:12-19</a> ahead of time.</p><p>We will also be celebrating communion on Sunday. For some reason, December communion is always a very powerful time for me as we reflect on the horrific brutality and cruelty of the cross even while we anticipate the birth of the innocent infant who would eventually be crucified on it. It's stirring to say the least. I know you will be stirred on Sunday. C U then.</p><p>Together for Him,</p><p>Nathan</p>"}]
