[{"Date":"September 7th 2012","Author":"Nathan Tuckey","Message":"<p>Hello eNewsers!</p><p>Hopefully many of you can join us for Friday Night Fireworks this evening here at SRCC. It all starts at 7:30 pm with ice cream; fireworks go off at 9:00 pm at the Hunterdon Developmental Center (HDC) across the street.</p><p>This week Cherrie Weisel (SRCC's Facilities Coordinator) received a letter from HDC stating the following: \"On behalf of the residents and staff of the Hunterdon Developmental Center we once again wish to express our deepest appreciation for the generous use of your facility. The handicap accessibility, the beautiful patio area and the spacious classrooms allowed us to spread out and enjoy our fun filled week.\"</p><p>As I shared a few weeks ago, HDC utilizes SRCC's facilities each year for holding its own VBS. I am so thankful that SRCC's DNA is not one of hoarding what God has entrusted to us but that we instead have a passion to serve the community. Thank you so much for having this spirit and for financially giving in such a way that SRCC is able to have and maintain a facility that serves our community so well.</p><p>This Sunday I begin our fall message series entitled Colors of the New Community. If you read 2 Corinthians 1:3-7 (this Sunday's Bible passage) ahead of time it doesn't strike you as high energy verses to start off a fall ministry season. I'm extremely excited, however, about this message and this whole message series. Sunday's service will be incredibly impactful as we explore these verses, worship together, and celebrate communion. You will be deeply moved and stirred with fresh vision.</p><p>This Sunday and for the next several weeks a number of ministry areas begin to fire on all cylinders again. Sit up, hold on, and jump in.</p><p>See you Sunday.</p><p>Together For Him,</p><p>Nathan</p>"}]
