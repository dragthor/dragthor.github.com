[{"Date":"November 2nd 2012","Author":"Nathan Tuckey","Message":"<p>Hello eNews Friends,</p><p>I am hoping and praying that you and your family are safe and that damage from the storm is minimal. Probably most of you, like me, are without power. While our circumstances as followers of Christ may not be different from those around us, we do know that the care of our Father in heaven is with us and it is ultimately in Him that we place our trust.</p><p>One of my favorite verses has always been Psalm 28:7 â€“ \"The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart trusts in him, and I am helped. My heart leaps for joy and I will give thanks to him in song.\" While David affirms God is his strength and shield (implying things are unsettled and there is reason to fear), in the same breath he speaks of joy and thanksgiving. The storm has certainly made me conscious that the Lord is my only secure place for trust and that there is always reason to be thankful whatever the circumstances.</p><p>Electrical power has been restored to SRCC although the building has no phone or internet service. If it is helpful to anyone, please feel free to fill any water containers you may have from the hose at the patio steps.</p><p>Thankfully, we will be able to have services on Sunday as regularly scheduled. Understandably, some may not be able to make it due to continued blocked roads etc. Children's ministries will function according to the ability of volunteers to be present. Thank you to all of you for your committed service.</p><p>On Sunday we will look at 2 Corinthians 12:1-10 with a message entitled \"Strength in Weakness\". We will also have communion. I am looking forward to being together with you as we focus our hearts on the Lord who is our strength and shield.</p><p>Together For Him,</p><p>Nathan</p>"}]
