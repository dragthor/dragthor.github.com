[{"Date":"October 26th 2012","Author":"Nathan Tuckey","Message":"<p>Hello eNews Friends,</p><p>It sounds as though Sandy is coming our way. I'm sure you're all staying tuned.</p><p>Have you ever heard someone speak longingly about \"the church\" that existed back in the times of the New Testament when the Apostle Paul lived? The comparison between today's church and the first century church is sometimes made with a sense that it \"used to be so much better back then\" â€“ back then things were all on track and ministry was clean; today it's messy and \"just not how it used to be.\"</p><p>Well, this coming Sunday in our Colors of the New Community message series I will be looking at some verses throughout 2 Corinthians 11 that show ministry has always been messy. Our final point will come from <a href='http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%2011:25-33&version=NIV;NLT;MSG;NASB' target='_new'>2 Corinthians 11:25-33</a> and the title will be \"Adversity and Progress.\" I think it will both encourage and challenge all of us.</p><p>The service will start with a thought provoking video and a reflective prayer so, once again, make sure you are there on time and ready to open your heart. The Holy Spirit just might not leave out the first 5-10 minutes of the service in which He might do something special in your life.</p><p>In addition we will be showing some more baptisms from the summer. And, speaking of baptism, we will be offering a discussion time called \"Understanding Baptism\" at 7:00 Sunday evening in the hospitality room. If it is more convenient for you, Understanding Baptism will also be offered on Sunday morning November 4th during the second service. If you haven't been baptized as a follower of Jesus, I encourage you to explore taking this step.</p><p>Together For Him,</p><p>Nathan</p>"}]
