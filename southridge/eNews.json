[{"Date":"November 21st 2012","Author":"Nathan Tuckey","Message":"<p>Hello eNews Friends,</p><p>Thank you so much for all the food items, turkeys, and winter coats that were brought in the last couple of weeks. Several people from SRCC delivered them to Jersey City on Monday and from what I hear it greatly blessed those who were recipients. God's love was truly extended even as His grace was at work in our own lives through giving. We will have some pictures on Sunday.</p><p>This evening at 7:00 is the Thanksgiving Eve service here at South Ridge. It is a time to slow down and establish our heats in thankfulness before the onset of a busy Thanksgiving weekend. Much of the service is an \"open mic\" time for people to share thoughts of thankfulness, expressions of praise to the Father, or meaningful verses of Scripture. Come prepared to share and begin the Thanksgiving weekend with a true spirit of thankfulness.</p><p>This coming Sunday Pete Gatto will be speaking. Pete, his wife Cher, and their children lead Rancho El Camino on the Baja Peninsula of Mexico. It is a great ministry that uses horses to bring God's healing grace into the brokenness of many lives. Pete is passionate guy and I know you will be moved by what he shares. I am looking forward to it. The Gattos will be back on Sunday afternoon from 3:00-5:00 pm for an interactive time of further discussion about the ranch's ministry.</p><p>Lastly, after Sunday's \"benediction\" someone came up and told me that he felt strongly prompted by God to slowly drive local county roads on Thanksgiving Day and pray for God's hand to be strongly at work among us. So, if you get behind a slow car on Thursday, be nice!</p><p>May you have a blessed Thanksgiving,</p><p>Nathan</p>"}]
