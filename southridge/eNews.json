[{"Date":"September 28th 2012","Author":"Nathan Tuckey","Message":"<p>Hello eNews Friends,</p><p>This Sunday I will continue in our series Colors of the New Community by looking at 2 Corinthians 6:14-7:1. These verses in Paul's letter are not the cuddly kind . . . although I'm not sure anything in Paul's letters are cuddly . . .but they are high challenge verses for how we live our lives for a maximum contribution to God's kingdom. I am looking forward to sharing this with you.</p><p>Also this Sunday, SRCC ministry partners Pete & Cher Gatto and their family will be saying  \"hello\" and providing a short update regarding Rancho El Camino in Mexico. For those who haven't been around for a while, Peter was the youth pastor here at SRCC about six years ago. You might want to check out the ranch's web site here.</p><p>Lastly, on Wednesday evening some \"electro malfunctions\" in Dori Parker's heart sent her off to the hospital. Due to a very high heart rate caused by the faulty \"electro malfunctions\" there was some minor damage to her heart muscle â€“ i.e. she had a mild heart attack. In getting to the bottom of this doctors also found some indications of heart disease. The long and short is that she is home from the hospital, doing very well, her prognosis is excellent, and there is much to be thankful for that these things were discovered at this early stage of life (she's young!). Dori, Stephen and her family would really appreciate your prayers as decisions are made about further treatments and medications. If you want to send a note to tell them you are thinking and praying for them, reply to this <a href='mailto:rindyk@southridgecc.org'>email</a> with the words you would like to share and we will see this gets printed and delivered. Most of all we want her to get some rest!</p><p>Together For Him,</p><p>Nathan</p>"}]
