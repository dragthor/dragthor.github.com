[{"Date":"January 4th 2013","Author":"Nathan Tuckey","Message":"<p>Hello eNews Friends,</p><p>This Sunday is part two of our message series with a confusing title. If I have it right, last Sunday was Here from Where and this Sunday is Where from Here.  We'll take a brief look at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mobile.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%206:1-7&version=NIV;NLT;MSG\">Acts 6:1-7</a> and provide some updates about SRCC's ministry.</p><p>What strikes me about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mobile.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%206:1-7&version=NIV;NLT;MSG\">Acts 6:1-7</a> is the unique challenges that confronted the church as it spread its wings and grew. There is only one way to avoid problems and challenges â€“ that is to be dead. And since being dead is not something that Jesus intended his church to be, it means there will always be fresh opportunities and challenges.</p><p>During this season at South Ridge we are also highlighting opportunities for groups. One of the elective groups being offered in another week or so is Financial Peace University (FPU). If you have a restless feeling that your finances are managing you more than you are managing your finances, FPU may be just for you. It's a video based series that is non-threatening, engaging and even enjoyable!</p><p>So, if fear of facing reality has kept you from taking a major step forward in getting your financial house in order or has caused rifts in your marriage, now would be a great season to change all that. If, on the other hand, your financial house is in order but you simply want to be more intentional, FPU would fit the bill.</p><p>To check out all SRCC's groups, go to South Ridge's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.southridgecc.org/\">home page</a>; click on the Groups icon. For FPU scroll down and check out the Electives. You'll find a place to register.</p><p>Together For Him,</p><p>Nathan</p>"}]
