[{"Date":"August 10th 2012","Author":"Nathan Tuckey","Message":"<p>Hello eNews Friends,</p><p>This coming Sunday Ben Stapley will be tackling the 7th commandment in our message series TENder Commandments by looking at \"Do Not Commit Adultery.\" Living in the sexually obsessed culture that we do, this command has plenty of relevance for all of our lives. The message will be appropriate to the limited summer children's ministries.</p><p>Yesterday and today the Global Leadership Summit has been taking place. The SRCC team attends the two day event at an Allentown PA location. It's two days packed full of challenging talks that stretch thinking and challenge us to effective action.</p><p>Two quick thoughts . . .</p><p>First, I am blown away again this year that over 60 people from SRCC commit two days and absorb the financial cost of the conference to expand their vision and grow toward greater effectiveness in serving the kingdom of heaven. I honestly don't know of another church the size of SRCC where so many people attend this event.</p><p>Second, I love the diversity of SRCC's team. I also don't know of another church whose team attending the Summit is made up of both those who have served at the church for decades as well as those who are in their early twenties and just jumping in to ministry leadership. It's truly amazing.</p><p>I am humbled to be part of such an incredible church where people have a hunger and thirst to see God's purposes move forward. It also stirs up a challenge - if you are not connected to an area of service within SRCC's ministry for this fall, I would highly challenge you to jump into the game. God's kingdom is moving; His purposes are expanding; I can't imagine staying in the seats . . . when Jesus went to the cross.</p><p>Together for Him,</p><p>Nathan</p>"}]
