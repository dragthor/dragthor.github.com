[{"Date":"December 7th 2012","Author":"Nathan Tuckey","Message":"<p>Hello eNews friends,</p><p>It sure is a damp and raw day out there. I hope you are staying warm and dry.</p><p>This coming weekend is a neighborly time for SRCC. On Saturday afternoon at 1:15 the SRCC's children's ministry will present the musical drama Camel Lot. Among those attending will be residents from the Hunterdon Developmental Center, the state run institution across the street from the church that provides care for those with disabilities. This \"field trip\" is a highlight of the year not only for the residents but also for the employees who bring them. The unrestrained enthusiasm that some residents demonstrate brings a smile to anyone's face.</p><p>Sunday morning's regular services will also feature the children's musical drama.</p><p>On Sunday afternoon, over twenty volunteers from SRCC's worship team and prison ministry will hold two worship celebration services at the Edna Mahan Correctional Facility located behind the Developmental Center. We have full clearance for the whole band to participate, and from what I understand this will be a first for worship services like this to happen within the prison walls.</p><p>There will actually be two services â€“ one for minimum security in early afternoon and another for maximum security in early evening. The prison is permitting eighty inmates to attend each service, and we anticipate each service will be at capacity. I am looking forward to sharing a short message of God's love at each service. All of us have a sense of anticipation as we walk uncharted territory in faith. Please pray for God's Spirit to work in mighty ways among the inmates as well as the prison's administrative and security staff.</p><p>Thank you for being a community that Embraces God's Grace and Extends God's Love with such vitality.</p><p>Together For Him,</p><p>Nathan</p>"}]
