[{"Date":"August 27th 2012","Author":"Nathan Tuckey","Message":"<p>Hello eNews Friends,</p><p>I know it's a Monday, but I thought I would shoot out a quick note between last weekend and the upcoming Labor Day weekend.</p><p>As you heard Sunday, I did the teaching at the worship service that SRCC led yesterday at the Edna Mahan Correctional Facility. Jeremy Moore led worship for the forty or so inmates attending and other SRCC volunteers read Scripture and shared a faith story.</p><p>What surprised me most was the sense of joy and fellowship. It was hugely evident that the ladies are loved and served so well by those from SRCC who faithfully invest in these women on an ongoing and regular basis. I felt like I was stepping in to a \"family circle\" of sorts. One lady thanked me for the towels given by SRCC some time ago. Her words weren't exactly this, but the sense was \"thank you for thinking that we were worth it.\" Those towels still deeply remind the ladies that they are not merely disposable human beings, but that they are created in God's image and the focus of His love.</p><p>This morning I gave Brian Dennison a call. For those who may not know, Brian pastors Berean Christian Fellowship Church in Kenner, Louisiana. SRCC partnered with this church following Hurricane Katrina to get them \"up and running\" again. I called to let Brian know I was thinking of him with the impending arrival of hurricane Isaac. He asked for our prayers and still appreciates all the ways SRCC was involved in the past several years. Please pray for them.</p><p>This coming Sunday, Steve Sargent will share some updates from Pastor Henry in Zimbabwe. We will also be looking at the final command of our TENder Commandments series.</p><p>The kingdom of heaven moves on . . .</p><p>Together For Him,</p><p>Nathan</p>"}]
