[{"Date":"Friday, February 01, 2013","Author":"Nathan Tuckey","Passage":"Mark 1:21-34","Message":"<p>Hello eNews Friends,</p><p></p><p>Where did those mid-week sixty degree temperatures get to?</p><p></p><p>If you have a moment right now, breathe a prayer for over 100 SRCC junior & senior high students headed off to the weekend retreat. Along with them will be a number of volunteers who will be leading worship, having conversations, and experiencing the weekend with them. They are heroes.</p><p></p><p>Last week I read the local Hunterdon County Democrat's article about the level of drug use among students in Hunterdon County. The article scratched the surface of only this one issue confronting youth. There are a myriad of other issues that could be looked at. I am so thankful for SRCC's robust youth ministry that proactively helps students know and understand that they have a Creator; that they have purpose; and that they are deeply loved. Please pray for all of them.</p><p></p><p>This Sunday we will be celebrating communion and I will also be giving the message from Mark 1:21-34. I have a couple of things in mind to share that will give you some fresh perspective and new insight on a few issues in our cultural.  I'm looking forward in a huge way to walking through these verses that contain something rather strange and foreign to us â€“ a shrieking demon of all things.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, it's February 1st, and we are up to Mark 4 in reading through the gospels. Pick up a book mark with the reading schedule at the welcome center on Sunday.</p><p></p><p>Together For Him,</p><p></p><p>Nathan</p>"}]
