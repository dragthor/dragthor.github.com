[{"Date":"January 4th 2013","Author":"Nathan Tuckey","Message":"<p>Happy New Year, eNews Friends!</p><p>This coming Sunday is the first Sunday of the New Year! I know that's obvious, but I am very excited about it. I am confident God's Spirit will work deeply and your soul will be stirred for the coming year.</p><p>I'm taking the first two Sundays in the year to talk about how SRCC fits into God's work of redemption in this world. I'm afraid if I mention this Sunday's message title it's going to be confusing so just come and find out. I'm taking grief for it. Our Scripture passage will be <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mobile.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028:16-20&version=NIV\">Matthew 28:16-20</a>. Take a moment to read it before Sunday.</p><p>We will also celebrate communion. I'm deeply moved every time we celebrate communion, but the first communion on the year's first Sunday is particularly meaningful. The songs and special components our programming team has planned for this Sunday's communion are especially moving. Please come on time expecting God to move in your heart.</p><p>If you haven't started reading the gospels yet, you are not too far behind! We start the message series from Mark on January 20th, but in the mean time our reading schedule as of today has us up to Matthew 4. Bookmarks with the schedule will be available again this Sunday; you can also find the reading schedule through the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.southridgecc.org/gospelreading.htm\">Reading the Gospels</a> link on SRCC's website.</p><p>Finally, THANK YOU so much for an incredible year-end out pouring of financial generosity. I'll provide more of an update on Sunday, but through you God allowed SRCC to finish 2012 strong with a great foundation for 2013.</p><p>I'm not sure I've ever been more excited about what God might have in store for SRCC in the coming year.</p><p>Together For Him,</p><p>Nathan</p>"}]
