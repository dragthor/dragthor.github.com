[{"Date":"December 14th 2012","Author":"Nathan Tuckey","Message":"<p>Hello eNews Friends,</p><p>This Sunday I will continue our Old Fashioned Christmas message series by starting with <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://mobile.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201:1-4,%2014&version=NIV;NLT;MSG\">John 1:1-4 & 14</a> as we explore the theme: \"The Triumph of Presence.\" From John's gospel, we will travel from one end of the Bible in Genesis to the other end of the Bible in Revelation as we look at God's desire to be present with His people. At the heart of it all is the Christmas story.</p><p>I've heard great things about the Christmas backpack initiative, and I know many groups and ministries are banding up and accomplishing this together. Some people are purchasing backpacks; others are purchasing items to place inside; and everyone together is wrapping the contents and praying that those who eventually receive these packs will have a glimpse of God's love. Each pack also has a New Testament. Who can know what eternal results will come of this.</p><p>I'll give a brief update this Sunday on the prison worship services. It was a long afternoon and evening with lots of waiting, but it was well worth it! The services were impactful, and the women inmates were filled with excitement and appreciation beyond words. God was at work in mighty ways, and there is so much to be thankful for.</p><p>Speaking of thankfulness, I am so thankful for ALL of you who make SRCC's mission to Embrace God's Grace & Extend God's Love so much more than just words on a page. I'm blown away by the heart, passion and abilities of so many SRCC volunteers who role up their sleeves and allow God's Spirit to empower them for His service. Whether it's in small ways or big ways, you contribute to God's presence being seen in this world. THANK YOU!</p><p>Together For Him,</p><p>Nathan</p>"}]
