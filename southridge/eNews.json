[{"Date":"Friday, April 12, 2013","Author":"Nathan Tuckey","Passage":"Mark 3:23-35","Message":"<p>Hello eNews Friends,</p><p>I'm thankful for the much needed rain this morning . . . but miss the warm sunny temperatures.</p><p>This Sunday I will be looking at Mark 3:23-35 with a message entitled The Strength of Grace. We'll first pick up some thoughts from last Sunday and then move on. I believe the Holy Spirit will use the message time to prompt some fresh thinking for each of us. While we often think of grace as being easy and effortless, Jesus' stirring words piercingly lead us to understand it differently. Implementing grace in our lives is not for the faint of heart. I'm also looking forward to some great time in worship on Sunday.</p><p>Tomorrow is the Springalive event! It should be a raucously fun time for the whole family. Tickets (free) are required for this event and from what I understand there are only a few left. Doors open at 4:00. I am thrilled to be part of a church that has a vision for families having good, solid fun. That can be hard to find. God's love will also be shared. It should be a great time.</p><p>Thanks for the thoughts, actions, and prayers this week related to my dad's memorial services. Being on the receiving end of your love causes me to ask God to help me to love others more with the kind of love that I have been shown. It causes deep reflection. Thanks so much.</p><p>I am greatly looking forward to Sunday. See you then.</p><p>Together For Him,</p><p>Nathan</p>"}]
