[{"Date":"Friday, May 24, 2013","Author":"Nathan Tuckey","Passage":"Mark 6:7-13","Message":"<p>Happy Memorial Day Weekend eNews Friends!</p><p>This Sunday Jeremy Moore will be leading us in the teaching time by looking at Mark 6:7-13. In this passage Jesus sends out the disciples to impact the world around them. We are still being sent by the very same Jesus. I will also be leading us in some moments of prayer for those in Oklahoma.</p><p>Our Gospel reading schedule has us at Luke 10 today. Luke 10:23 says, Then he turned to his disciples and said privately, \"Blessed are the eyes that see what you see.\" The disciples had front row seats on seeing the work of Jesus - his power to set people free; his love and grace in action; his authority over storms, disease, hunger and death.</p><p>Two thousand years later the work of Jesus continues. We are able to see so much more than even the original twelve disciples saw. The challenge is we become immune from seeing. Our eyes are on the obvious of what's in front of us - our circumstances, our schedules, our screens, our own stories. To really see is an intentional choice - to see God's presence, his beauty, his rest, his peace, his grace, his love.</p><p>I hope all of you have a wonderful Memorial Day weekend. Take some time to appreciate that what we enjoy in the United States has come at the cost of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice. Blessing always comes from sacrifice. Take time to see.</p><p>Together For Him,</p><p>Nathan</p>"}]
