[{"Date":"August 17th 2012","Author":"Nathan Tuckey","Message":"<p>Hello eNews Friends,</p><p>In our message series TENder Commandments this coming Sunday I will look at command #8: \"Do Not Steal.\" It probably ages me that my primary image for this command is one kid stealing a pencil off another kid's desk in school. One again, however, my mind exploded this week with significance of such a simple command. You may want to read 1 Timothy 6:6-10; 17-19 ahead of time.</p><p>A few dots also connected in my head this week. A couple eNews notes ago I alluded to a passage in Ephesians related to how Jesus \"fills everything in every way.\" This week my mind was drawn to a phrase in Ephesians 3:19 â€“ \"that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.\" Ephesians drives home the point that we can be full and complete people only through God's fullness in us.</p><p>It dawned on me that the reason we violate nearly every command is precisely because our lives are empty. We commit adultery because we are empty; we covet because we are empty; we steal because we are empty. Emptiness results in stealing. Fullness results in giving. Do we underestimate what it means to be filled with God's fullness?</p><p>Are you an empty person? Are you a FULL person? Do you live empty? Do you live FULL?</p><p>See you on Sunday.</p><p>Together For Him,</p><p>Nathan</p>"}]
