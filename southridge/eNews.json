[{"Date":"Friday, April 26, 2013","Author":"Nathan Tuckey","Passage":"Mark 5:21-24, 35-43","Message":"<p>Hello eNews Friends,</p><p>Today was the \"Walk by Faith\" event for Crossroads Christian Academy (CCA) which is the pre-school through 8th grade school that operates as a ministry of South Ridge. \"Walk by Faith\" is CCA's largest fundraising event of the year with a goal to raise over $30,000. The kids contact grandparents, uncles, aunts, friends and just about any other living person they can think of to sponsor them in their walk around a quarter mile track outlined on SRCC's side field.</p><p>After seeing the sunny weather outside, hearing the blaring music and watching the kids have so much fun, it took all I had to get my work done in the office. It was a good day for Crossroads and is just another way the ministry of South Ridge has an eternal impact far beyond what happens Sunday morning.</p><p>Tomorrow South Ridge hosts the Ramabai Mukti Mission for its annual conference. SRCC has long financially supported Mukti as it serves some of the most vulnerable women and impoverished young girls in India with the love of Christ. You can only imagine the desperate needs that exist and how much impact a ministry like this has that loves and serves the most destitute in that culture.</p><p>This Sunday morning there will be some baptisms during each service, and I will be doing the teaching from Mark 5:21-24 & 35-43 with a message entitled \"The Mystery of Waiting.\" I'm approaching this passage from a unique angle, and I believe God's Spirit will stir fresh insights in our hearts. Be there on time; we will jump right into a full service.</p><p>Together For Him,</p><p>Nathan</p>"}]
