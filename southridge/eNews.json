[{"Date":"Friday, April 19, 2013","Author":"Nathan Tuckey","Passage":"Mark 5:1-20","Message":"<p>Hello eNews Friends,</p><p>This week's rain and warmer weather has made it truly seem like spring. The grass is definitely getting greener and the leaves on the trees are beginning to sprout. It's a welcome sign of new life!</p><p>This Sunday Ben Stapley, who is Director of Programming and Media here at South Ridge, will be continuing in the Footsteps message series from the Gospel of Mark by looking at Mark 5:1-20. It's a strange story; take a few minutes and read it. Jesus casts out demons from a man. Those demons enter a herd of pigs which then self-destruct by running over a cliff.</p><p>The story might seem too primitive for our modern scientifically oriented world. While our modern world generally acknowledges spiritual reality, a story that talks about demons and possessed pigs goes further than what seems sensible.</p><p>One thought occurs to me about this story in connection to the horror we saw in Boston this past Monday. Most of the time evil functions more subtly than it did this past Monday at the Boston Marathon or in Mark's story of the possessed pigs. Most of the time evil is more understated, more restrained, and less obvious.</p><p>But the fact of the matter is that evil is real. And once in a while the wraps come off. We are reminded that it needs to be conquered - not just out there where it's obvious, but in our own lives where it's subtle.</p><p>Please continue to pray for those in Boston. Pray for our whole country. Pray for the world. Evil is real. It's out there. In less obvious ways it's in us. We all need a conquering Savior.</p><p>Together For Him,</p><p>Nathan</p>"}]
