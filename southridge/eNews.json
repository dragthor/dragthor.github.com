[{"Date":"Tuesday, March 19, 2013","Author":"Nathan Tuckey","Passage":"Mark 14:32-42","Message":"<p>Hello eNews Friends,</p><p>A quick early-in-the-week eNews -</p><p>This past weekend's Feed The Need event was truly a work of God. A total of 544,920 meals got packed by over 2,400 volunteers and $119,000 was given. Goals were broken in meals packed, volunteers serving, and donations received! I am truly reminded that \"Our God is Greater,\" and I am so thankful and grateful for the mighty work of God's Spirit among us.</p><p>This is enough food for 1,491 children to have one meal a day for a year. And as you probably know, much of this food will be going to Zimbabwe and Swaziland, a region of the world where SRCC is already highly engaged.</p><p>Beyond the food, I can't express how powerful it was to have people from all walks of life and from all backgrounds - both religious and nonreligious - participate in this event. The fruits to this will continue long after this weekend.</p><p>A quick reminder - this Wednesday evening (March 20th) at 6:30 pm I will be leading Understanding Baptism in the office area. If you have never been baptized as a follower of Christ, this would be the time to take the step. The sense of following after Christ through baptism is a powerful experience that I can't imagine saying no to. Simply reply to this email and let Angela know that you would like to participate.</p><p>Spring arrives tomorrow! . . . although more snow/rain is forecasted for next Monday. What's the deal with this?</p><p>Together For Him,</p><p>Nathan</p>"}]
