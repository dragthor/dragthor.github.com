[{"Date":"December 22nd 2012","Author":"Nathan Tuckey","Message":"<p>Hello eNews Friends,</p><p>Well . . . congratulations on still being here! In spite of the Mayan calendar, the world has not ended!</p><p>This coming Sunday morning Mat Dawson will continue our message series Old Fashioned Christmas by looking at the \"Triumph of Peace.\" In addition to basing the Christmas story in the first few chapters of Genesis, Mat will also be looking at <a href=\"http://mobile.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%209:6-7\" target=\"_blank\">Isaiah 9:6-7</a> – some of the most famous verses in the Old Testament for their description of the coming Messiah.</p><p>On both Sunday and Monday evenings at 5:00 & 7:00 pm SRCC will have Christmas services. Last evening I stopped by the worship center to get a glimpse of the Christmas services as the worship team and technical programming team were rehearsing. Together we stood on the stage in a circle for a few moments committing ourselves and the four services to God in prayer. The drama team did the same on Tuesday evening.</p><p>I am looking forward to how God will move. I am confident He will. There is still time to hand out an invitation card or two. Also, if possible, consider being a part of the services on Sunday evening to have seats available on Monday for those in our community who may be more accustomed to \"visiting a church\" on Christmas eve.</p><p>Lastly, the participation in the backpack project has been amazing! This afternoon I talked to someone who came to SRCC for the first time about three weeks ago. They were sharing how they involved their neighborhood in filling 4-5 backpacks. I was blown away. From what I hear, it’s hard to buy a backpack in just about any store in Hunterdon County. I know why . . .</p><p>Merry Christmas,</p><p>Nathan</p>"}]
