[{"Date":"Friday, March 01, 2013","Author":"Nathan Tuckey","Passage":"Mark 2:23 - 3:6","Message":"<p>Hello eNews Friends,</p><p>I think spring is lurking out there somewhere!</p><p>It's been a full week with our guest Nyasha Manyau from Zimbabwe. As I've had some opportunities to hear Nyasha share additional stories and experiences from her life and ministry throughout the week, I've come to realize that what was shared this past Sunday morning merely scratched the surface of this courageous woman. Those of you registered for the Ladies Dessert this evening and/or the Leaders' Gathering tomorrow morning are in for a deep and profound experience.</p><p>This coming Sunday I'll be going back for part two in exploring the same section of Mark that we looked at two Sundays ago - Mark 2:23-3:6. I think you'll find that what we talk about this Sunday will unfold a whole different layer of what Jesus meant when he said that he was \"Lord of the Sabbath\" (2:28). I'm looking forward to it!</p><p>One final note - this round of Discovering South Ridge has been full! The next Discovering South Ridge will be coming in early June. It's been a great experience connecting with those who have recently started to attend SRCC as well as some who have been around for a while.</p><p>See you on Sunday.</p><p>Together For Him,</p><p>Nathan</p>"}]
