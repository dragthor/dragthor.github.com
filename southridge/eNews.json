[{"Date":"November 16th 2012","Author":"Nathan Tuckey","Message":"<p>Hello eNewsers,</p><p>I hope that you are all doing well.</p><p>This Sunday we will be finishing the Colors of the New Community message series by looking at <a target='_blank' href='http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%2013:11-14&version=NIV;NLT;MSG'>2 Corinthians 13:11-14</a>. While every message series is intended to be meaningful and purposeful, this series on the Colors of the New Community stirred something in me and, I think, in many of us beyond what was anticipated. God's Spirit breathed freshly into our own community here at SRCC through these ancient words.</p><p>Even though we are focusing on just a few final short verses this coming Sunday, I believe we will all be powerfully impacted. There are some really amazing nuggets in these final verses, and I am confident that if you give God's Spirit some room you will be moved as we conclude this message series. We will also be having a couple of baptisms earlier in the service.</p><p>Remember to bring along a few non-perishable Thanksgiving food items that will be given to those in need in Jersey City. And don't forget about the opportunity to donate a turkey as well â€“ it's supposed to be a frozen turkey! No live ones please. Additionally, we are collecting some winter coats. From what I understand, the help that some of these folks typically receive has been diverted to hurricane Sandy assistance. Your help is meaningful. Check out the  Thanksgiving Opportunities on the SRCC website for a reminder of more details.</p><p>Lastly, by this time next week the Thanksgiving holiday will be behind us. Hard to believe . . . huh? Don't just let it slip by. Be diligent in cultivating a true and humble spirit of thankfulness in your heart to God.</p><p>Together For Him,</p><p>Nathan</p>"}]
