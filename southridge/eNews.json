[{"Date":"Friday, March 15, 2013","Author":"Nathan Tuckey","Passage":"Mark 14:32-42","Message":"<p>Hello eNews Friends,</p><p>The first shift of Feed the Need 2013 has begun as I write this email. Please diligently pray for this event over the next sixty hours. Amazingly enough, the food packed this year will go to Zimbabwe and Swaziland. The decision about the food's destination is not something SRCC has a say in, but what a special gift from God that it will go to a country where SRCC is already heavily involved.</p><p>Beyond the literal life-saving impact this weekend will have on the lives of hundreds of starving children, it will also have a lasting impact on hundreds of people throughout Hunterdon County and our whole region. I'm personally excited about a team from Franklin Township that I've been able to gather together. It will be the first time many of them drive on to SRCC's campus. This will be true for hundreds of peopel this weekend.</p><p>SO . . . thank you to all of those who have already invested piles of hours in this weekend and will continue to do so for the next sixty hours. Their investment enables the rest of us to serve and impact our circle of relationships. Who knows the amount of eternal difference that will result from this powerful weekend. Pray hard; serve well; love deeply.</p><p>This week I received several notes about the deeply impacting moments of last Sunday's communion. One person commented it was the most meaningful communion they ever experienced. This Sunday I will continue our series, Path to the Cross, with a message entitled \"The Weight of Love\" from Mark 14:32-42. I believe our time will be powerful. Nyasha Manyau will also be with us to say farewell to the SRCC congregation as she heads back to Zimbabwe later in the week.</p><p>Together For Him,</p><p>Nathan</p>"}]
