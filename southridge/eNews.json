[{"Date":"Friday, March 22, 2013","Author":"Nathan Tuckey","Passage":"Mark 15:1-15","Message":"<p>Hello eNews Friends,</p><p>This Sunday is Palm Sunday. The next seven days, which for good reason have historically been labeled \"Holy Week,\" commemorate the entrance of Jesus into Jerusalem leading to His subsequent execution on a Roman cross, his burial in a tomb, and finally his resurrection. This week defines Christianity; it defines our lives as followers of Jesus.</p><p>This Sunday I will be continuing our message series, Path to the Cross, by looking at Mark 15:1-15 with a message entitled \"The Reverse of Judgment.\" It's a sobering passage as Jesus is accused and sentenced to execution. I think you will be deeply moved as we close the service on a powerful note. Additionally we will have a final Feed the Need update and the worship team has some great songs planned.</p><p>Please continue to pray for God's Spirit to be powerfully at work during this Easter season. Also be sensitive to whom God may place in your path to invite to church during this season of commemorating Jesus' death and resurrection.</p><p>C U Sunday!</p><p>Together for Him,</p><p>Nathan</p>"}]
