[{"Date":"August 3rd 2012","Author":"Nathan Tuckey","Message":"<p>Hello eNews Friends,</p><p>This Sunday I will be looking at Commandment #6 in our message series TENder Commandments. The command, \"You Shall not Murder\" is probably one of the commandments that we most easily think we have a clear pass on. It's safe to say that most of us have steered clear of outright murder.</p><p>But the command is more expansive than merely prohibiting murder. It dovetails well with what Jesus said is the greatest commandment: \"'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'\" (Matthew 22:37-39)</p><p>I've always known that the command included more than the mere prohibition of murder, but this week I have been freshly gripped with the magnitude of what the command encompasses. And along with that, I've been freshly convicted by God's Spirit of how far I fall short of fulfilling this \"basic\" command.</p><p>Fittingly enough, we will also be having communion. The crucifixion of Jesus starkly reminds us that we as human beings have collectively \"murdered God\" by our self-centered independence (a.k.a. sin), and yet receive life through Him.</p><p>Put all of the above together and the words of Frederick Buechner are stirring: \"The grace of God means something like: Here is your life. You might never have been, but you are because the party wouldn't have been complete without you.\" Think about that . . .</p><p>Lastly, don't forget that Sunday will be SRCC's blood drive.</p><p>Together For Him,</p><p>Nathan</p>"}]
