It strikes me that Jesus' statement, \"Follow me,\" comes in the immediate context of Jesus speaking about the \"kingdom of God.\" In ancient times, the claim that Jesus was King stood in stark contrast to the literal government \"king.\" That's totally foreign to us in western culture. But that doesn't mean we don't understand the idea of \"king.\" In our world, Jesus' claim to be king comes up against MY being king. The implications are endless . . .</p><p></p><p>Please continue to pray for SRCC's team on Long Island partnered with Samaritan's Purse to assist with the hurricane relief. I just talked to Steve Sargent and he said the team is having an unbelievable time. They have seen God move in the people they are helping in very powerful ways. Thank you so much for praying for them. Please continue!</p><p></p><p>Together For Him,</p><p></p><p>Nathan</p>"}]
