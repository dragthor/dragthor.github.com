[{"Date":"September 14th 2012","Author":"Nathan Tuckey","Message":"<p>Hello eNews Friends,</p><p>I hope that you are enjoying the beautiful weather we have had this week! While God is always worthy of our praise, there is something about the beauty of a fall day that clearly displays the wonder and goodness of our Creator.</p><p>Last Sunday SRCC had a wonderful fall start for a number of ministry areas. Children's ministry was brimming, the worship center was bustling, and student ministries had a booming Sunday evening. I was reminded once again that this structure and physical location we call \"church\" is not really the \"church.\" The church is people â€“ it's people like you and I who give testimony to God's living presence here on earth.</p><p>This Sunday I will once again be teaching from 2 Corinthians in our message series entitled Colors of the New Community. To get a jump start you can read 2 Corinthians 4:1-12. Verse 7 has always been one of my favorites where Paul makes references to us as \"jars of clay.\" We will be exploring what that means and its implications.</p><p>As you heard last Sunday and will hear again this Sunday, the fall is a great time to check out one of the many group settings at SRCC. While Sunday morning services provide an opportunity for worship, learning and encouragement; real growth typically happens in much smaller settings through participation, interaction and discussion. Check out the groups menu for a place where you can plug in and walk with others. You can also check this out online.</p><p>Together For Him,</p><p>Nathan</p>"}]
