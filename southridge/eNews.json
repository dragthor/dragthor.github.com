[{"Date":"October 12th 2012","Author":"Nathan Tuckey","Message":"<p>Hello eNews Friends,</p><p>It looks like a beautiful fall crisp weekend ahead.</p><p>Please pray for SRCC's youth and all volunteer leaders this weekend. Over one hundred of them will be gathered at nearby Camp Tecumseh for the fall retreat. It goes without saying that the lives of students are pulled in a hundred wrong directions in our culture; how amazing is it that such a huge group will have a focused opportunity to be strengthened in walking in the right direction this weekend.</p><p>What's just as exciting is that Peter Gatto (Peter was the former youth pastor of SRCC seven years ago and he and his family are now in Mexico extending God's love through Rancho El Camio) will be the speaker for the weekend and additional people from SRCC â€˜s regular worship team will be leading worship. This truly is the body at work serving one another, building each other up, and investing in the lives of one another. This is God's dream.</p><p>On Sunday Jeremy Moore will be teaching in our series Colors of the New Community by looking at 2 Corinthians 9:6-15. This will be part two of the generosity theme. As you sensed last Sunday, our goal for these messages on generosity is not to \"get people to give more.\" Instead, it's to cultivate a realization of all that we have been given through the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and allow generosity to flow naturally as an expression of the movement of God's Spirit.</p><p>One last thing - make sure you are there on time on Sunday. Early on in the services we will be showing some of the faith stories of people who were baptized this past summer. It will definitely be a highlight of a meaningful service.</p><p>Together For Him,</p><p>Nathan</p>"}]
