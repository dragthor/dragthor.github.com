[{"Date":"September 21st 2012","Author":"Nathan Tuckey","Message":"<p>Hello eNewsers,</p><p>This coming Sunday Mat Dawson will lead us in our message series entitled Colors of the New Community by looking at 2 Corinthians 5:11-21. The message title will be \"A Higher Vision.\" I'm a bit envious of Mat teaching this passage since it contains some of my favorite verses. Take at least 5-10 minutes between now and Sunday to sit quietly and reflect on them. Maybe you can do this before going off to sleep on Friday or Saturday evening.</p><p>I'm not sure where Mat will be focusing, but verse 17 is a fairly commonly known and quoted verse. Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, and the new has come.\" If you are anything like me, this verse may feel true some days, but not so much other days. Thankfully, our feelings don't determine its truth. The journey of the Christian life is continually reminding ourselves of the truth of what it means to be in Christ. The fact is that we are new, and as we nourish our souls in that reality we gradually see newness unfolding in our lives.</p><p>One last thing – on Saturday morning around eighty children and student ministry volunteers will be here for training. At our staff meeting on Wednesday afternoon this week I commented on the incredible commitment this represents on behalf of our volunteers. Last Saturday, I was involved with over 20 volunteers being trained as group leaders at SRCC. All of you have very busy lives. We all know that. But I am so proud of you – SRCC's kingdom minded volunteer force – who make an investment in being trained to serve our great God to the best of your ability. You guys rock!</p><p>Together For Him,</p><p>Nathan</p>"}]
