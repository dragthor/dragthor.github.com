[{"Date":"October 19th 2012","Author":"Nathan Tuckey","Message":"<p>Hello eNewsers,</p><p>In spite of the rain, I hope you are having a good Friday.</p><p>This Sunday I will be teaching from <a href='http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%2010:1-6&version=NIV;NLT;MSG;NASB' target='_blank'>2 Corinthians 10:1-6</a> in our message series Colors of the New Community. The title of the message is \"Fighting Well.\" The Scripture passage mentioned in each eNews is now a link where you can read the verses in one of four translations. Check it out.</p><p>What stands out from these verses is the language Paul uses. He talks about weapons we fight with, strongholds needing to be demolished, and thoughts that need to be taken captive. These are clearly battle terms. Apparently, living life as a follower of Jesus is not a walk in the park. Many people feel that there is something wrong with them if their journey is difficult and it feels like a battle. From what Paul says, there is probably something right happening if there is a battle going on. Start worrying if there is no heat of battle.</p><p>We will again be hearing faith stories and seeing baptisms from this past summer. Come prepared to have your heart moved as we are encouraged by gathering together, worshiping together, learning together, giving togehter, and serving together.</p><p>As I mentioned last week, choose to schedule your life on Sunday morning so you can be on time. Start that schedule Saturday if you need to. You enable God's Spirit to work in your life when you come with an open and unhurried heart. There is nothing that thwarts God's Spirit more than having our own spirit in a hurried and frenzied state.</p><p>Together For Him,</p><p>Nathan</p>"}]
