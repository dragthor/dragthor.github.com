[{"Date":"July 27th 2012","Author":"Nathan Tuckey","Message":"<p>Hello eNews Friends,</p><p>For the past week or so I've been thinking about Ephesians 1:22-23 - \"And God placed all things under His feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way.\"</p><p>This coming Tuesday evening our Elders will gather as we do for every 5th Tuesday of the month for a \"non-agenda\" meeting where our only focus is prayer and discussion about SRCC's ministry. These verses will be our focus. In a nutshell they tell us that God's people are filled with the fullness of the absolutely victorious Jesus who fills everything in every way. The \"everything in every way\" part doesn't leave much out does it?</p><p>Every molecule of life, every second of activity, every firing of a brain wave is rightfully the territory of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. There is no moment, no thought, and no act that is outside of the domain of Jesus. As individuals and as a church our calling is to unleash the filling Spirit of Christ in all aspects of life. Let those words haunt you for a few days ... \"the fullness of him who fills everything in every way.\"</p><p>This coming Sunday, Sam and Joan Fiore, SRCC missionaries to Italy, will be with us. Sam will be sharing a message entitled \"Keeping our Focus.\" Sam & Joan are truly part of the SRCC family, and Sam's messages are always a highlight for all of us. What I love most about Sam and Joan and their ministry is that they truly bring \"the fullness of him who fills everything and in every way\" to Italy.</p><p>See you Sunday.</p><p>Together For Him,</p><p>Nathan</p><p>PS - If you want to check out five different versions of those verses click <a target='_blank' href='http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:22-23&version=NASB;NLT;AMP;MSG;NIV1984'>here</a>.</p>"}]
