[{"Date":"July 20th 2012","Author":"Nathan Tuckey","Message":"<p>Hello eNews Friends,</p><p>The cooler temperatures and soaking rains are a welcome blessing! I am reminded of a verse tucked away in Psalm 72:5. \"He will be like rain falling on a mown field, like showers watering the earth.\"</p><p>The words are intended to reflect the benefits of an earthly king's reign, but all the kings of ancient Israel fell far short of the ideal. Ultimately, it's only the Good and Ultimate King who can renew our souls and bring fresh green shoots of growth through his love and grace. As you do errands or drive to appointments this weekend allow the fresh shoots of green grass on previously brown lawns to prompt your own soul to be watered by God's love for YOU.</p><p>This Sunday Mat Dawson continues in our series TENder Commandments by looking at Command #5 - \"Honor Your Father and Mother.\" As SRCC's pastor of Student Ministries I know Mat has a deep passion for this topic, and I am looking forward to being uncomfortably challenged. This command is not just for kids. It is for every one of us. So if you dare, come ready this Sunday.</p><p>We will also be hearing a brief update from Jeff & Karen Grant who are partnered with SRCC to connect God's love to students on NJ college campuses. They are doing a wonderful job. Lastly, we will be offering two opportunities this coming Sunday to serve others.</p><p>As the showers water the earth, may God's goodness water your soul.</p><p>Together For Him,</p><p>Nathan</p>"}]
